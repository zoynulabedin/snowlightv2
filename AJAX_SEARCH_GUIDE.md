### 🚀 **How It Works:**

#### 1. **Search API Route** (`/api/search`)

- Real-time AJAX requests to `/api/search` API
- Debounced search (300ms delay) to prevent excessive API calls
- localStorage integration for recent searches
- Responsive design with proper accessibility

#### 3. **Layout Integration** (`app/components/Layout.tsx`)

- Seamlessly integrated into the main header
- Maintains existing search functionality
- Preserves form submission for full search page

### 🎯 **User Experience:**
